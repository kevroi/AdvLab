    "$Gaussian$ $Beam$ $Experiment$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our setup of the Gaussian laser beam experiment! We are measuring the waist of a laser beam; the theory behind it can be found in several textbooks on lasers and optics. We used a HeNe diode laser from Thorlabs, with an output waist of 1.75 mm. After reflecting the beam off two mirrors, we focused it with a 75mm lens onto a razor blade, which was mounted onto two millimeter stages. One was controlled with a K cube stepper motor and it moved the blade perpendicular to laser path, and the other was moved by hand in the direction of the laser beam. We collected the beam with a DET36A photodetector, which was hooked up to a USB-6211 DAQ. We obtained this data by running a labview program that gave us the data from our DAQ. \n",
    "\n",
    "$An$ $Introduction$\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment meausures the waist of a laser beam, which is half of the diameter of the beam itself. From these measurements, it uses a parabolic fit to return the smallest possible waist, the confocal range, the divergence angle and the quality parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our setup used one HeNe diode laser, two mirrors, a 50mm and a 75mm lens, a razor blade, and a DET36A photodetector. Our laser is positioned at one corner of a table, pointed at a mirror, which reflects the beam 90 degrees. This mirror reflects the beam onto another mirror, which, once again, reflects the beam 90 degrees. The beam then goes through the 75 mm lens and is focused on a razor blade. Since the light beam diverges after it hits the razor, we use the 50mm lens to focus the beam back onto the photodetector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain our results by moving a knife edge perpendicular to a laser beam (we call this the x direction) while collecting intensity data. We moved the knife so that our starting position was the point at which the knife edge just barely touched the beam and the final position just barely blocked all of the beam. This gives data that can be fit to a known function in order to extract a waist parameter. However, this waist is dependent on the distance of the razor itself from the photodetector (we call this the z direction). At some z, this waist will hit a minimum. By collecting several measurements at different z positions, we obtain another set of data that can be fit to obtain all parameters of interest listed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "$Tips:$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful things we discovered along the way included\n",
    "\n",
    "* We used an optical filter with ND=1.6 in order to avoid saturating the detector (Output voltage should be ~200mV)\n",
    "* We connected our detector to the DAQ in differential mode; this required two 56 kOhm resistors for this specific device\n",
    "* Using a newer razor blade yielded drastically better data\n",
    "* Make sure that all the lens are positioned correctly\n",
    "* Using a second lens to focus onto the detector is a good idea; you do not want the spot from the laser to be larger than your detector\n",
    "* Finding the correct starting position for taking data is best done by choosing a large step size and noting when the intensity drops\n",
    "* Make sure that the step size is sufficiently small so that the descent of the erfc is well captured\n",
    "* Using more than 50 steps for measuring the waist is not recommended \n",
    "* Collecting an equal number of points on either side of the waist gives a good fit\n",
    "* If there is a lot of noise, consider taking several data points per z position\n",
    "* The beam is often not perfectly straight so the starting position will change for different z\n",
    "* Make sure your DAQ is set up and connected properly in differential mode. Check the NI website for instructions"

The covariance matrices are saved for each z data point in the list called \"errors\", and the standard error for w is saved in an array called stderror. Sometimes, curve_fit will not work; to fix this, it is important to help the curve_fit function by providing a good guess for the fit values; often times, it will return values of 1 or other unreasonable fits if a guess is not provided. A test run is recommended to get a feel for where $x_0$ might be, since that seems to be the part the program struggles with. Another important thing to note is that the step size matters and getting about 8-12 data points during the \"descent\" part of the erfc is key to a good fit. If the fits are not working for multiple data sets, one can try fitting only one and graphing it with the following code to troubleshoot. If it is obvious that the fit is bad, mess with the guess to try and improve it. "

    "Typically, the waist is on the order of tens of micrometers, and the $M^2$ is about 1, usually a little greater than 1. The error bars are really hard to get down, due to the fact that our waist measurements are on the order of tens of microns. The standard deviation we got was 500 nanometers, which is the wavelength of the laser we were using. It would be hard to reduced error bars beyond that, but it left us with a whole micron of uncertainty in our measurement. This is most likely due to diffraction effects near the edge of the razor; we cannot fix the unevenness of the blade at the micron scale. Also, it is often hard to get a perfect 90 degree reflection off the second mirror; as a result, the range of the data taken will have to be different for different z values. As long as the deflection is not too great, it will not greatly affect the three measurements above. However, z0 and x0 will usually be nonsense. Since these data do not come in any relevant calculation, we do not see it as an issue. "
